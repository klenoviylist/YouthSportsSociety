                            Kidsâ€™ character and moral principles are formed through fair play.
                            Moreover, children who are actively engaged in sports can be good role models
                            for their peers from school, neighborhood, and inspire
                            them to start playing some sports as well.

                            Through sports kids learn about success and failure.
                            Losing often motivates them to work even harder for next time.
